# PokemonData

This is the analysis of the statistics of all 800 Pokemon from 7 editions. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon

The project is using Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib.

I will try to find any correlations between the statistics, types and abilities of Pokemons. I would like to know what will be the average Pokemon. Are there any clear differences between normal and legendary Pokemon?
